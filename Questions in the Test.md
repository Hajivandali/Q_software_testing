<h3 align="center">Software Testing </h3>
<br>
<P>
    Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application or system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and works as expected. It helps identify bugs, errors, and vulnerabilities that could impact the software's functionality, reliability, and security. There are various types of software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, and security testing. 
    Software testing can be done manually or using automated testing tools. It is an essential part of the software development 
    lifecycle and helps ensure the delivery of high-quality software to end-users.

<h2>Why are Software Testing Principles Important?</h2>
<p>The belief is ubiquitous that success comes from adhering to a set of principles. Whether to stay fit, meet work-related goals, or achieve life goals, there are often specific targets and rules we must follow to accomplish them. The same holds true for software testing. As a whole, software testing principles describe how software testers or testing engineers should create bug-free, clear, and maintainable code. Engineering is not a science in which you can wave a magic wand and make a jumble of variables, classes, and functions into flawless code, but you can use some principles to determine if you are doing things right. Test principles will help you draft error-catching test cases and create an effective Test Strategy. Software testing is governed by the following seven principles:</p>
<li>
Testing shows the presence of defects  
</li>
<li>Exhaustive testing is not possible
</li>
<li>Early testing
</li>
<li>Defect clustering
</li>
<li>Pesticide paradox
</li>
<li>Testing is context dependent
</li>
<li>Absence of errors fallacy
</li>

<p>
    The first stage of software testing is typically the planning and preparation phase. In this stage, the testing team identifies the objectives, scope, and requirements of the testing process. They define the testing strategy, create a test plan, and determine the resources and timelines for testing. The team also identifies the test environment, including the hardware, software, and network configurations required for testing. Additionally, they establish the test cases and test scenarios that will be used to evaluate the software. This stage sets the foundation for the subsequent testing activities.

    equirement Analysis is the first step of the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC). In this phase quality assurance team understands the requirements like what is to be tested. If anything is missing or not understandable then the quality assurance team meets with the stakeholders to better understand the detailed knowledge of requirements.
