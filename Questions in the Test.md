    Software testing is the process of evaluating a software application or system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and works as expected. It helps identify bugs, errors, and vulnerabilities that could impact the software's functionality, reliability, and security. There are various types of software testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, and security testing. 
    Software testing can be done manually or using automated testing tools. It is an essential part of the software development 
    lifecycle and helps ensure the delivery of high-quality software to end-users.
